I did some research on some Linux software that could handle the communication between the UPS and server, and I found <a href="http://apcupsd.org">apcupsd</a>, a daemon that polls the UPS status every once in a while and reacts accordingly. Perfect!</p><p>But while <a href="http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html">the documentation</a> is very good and extensive, I found it hard to discover what I needed to do – run a custom script when the UPS is on battery power. This seems like a common task one would like to do, to e.g. perform cleanup or notify someone when the power's out.</p><p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>Put your scripts in <code>/etc/apcupsd</code> that are named the <a href="http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#customizing-event-handling">appropriate event</a> you want to react to.</p><p>For example, if you wanted to react to the <code>onbattery</code> event (fired when APCUPSD is sure that the UPS is on battery power), you would make a script in <code>/etc/apcupsd/onbattery</code> with these contents:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash
# Do whatever you need here!
curl &quot;https://example.org/powerfailure&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to <code>chmod +x</code> your script, too. For a full list of events, <a href="http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#customizing-event-handling">check here</a>.</p><p>For my use case, I made the script send a message to my Telegram channel when the UPS loses power:</p><p>
    <script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?5" data-telegram-post="tjhorner/532" data-width="100%"></script>
</p><p>...and another when power is restored:</p><p>
    <script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?5" data-telegram-post="tjhorner/533" data-width="100%"></script>

As a foray into the beginning of 2019, I'll detail every step of that plan, justify why I made it, and answer any questions you might have about it.</p><h4 id="so-here-s-my-crazy-plan-">So here's my crazy plan.</h4><ul><li><strong>Take a gap year.</strong> Apply to many jobs and gain more experience along the way.</li><li><strong>If I get a good job that pays well, I'll keep it.</strong> Otherwise, refer to the next step.</li><li><strong>Discover and apply to relevant colleges (if the job search fails).</strong> I have already applied and been accepted to several institutions.</li></ul><hr><h1 id="first-i-m-taking-a-gap-year-">First, I'm taking a gap year.</h1><p>During this gap year, I'll apply to different positions at many different companies to see what comes of it. While I wait for results, I'll gain as much experience as I can with my newfound free time.</p><p>The primary reason I chose not to go directly into college is because I can confidently say that in my position, <strong>college would be more or less a waste of time and money.</strong> As someone interested in software engineering and even just computers in general, there are so many resources out there that not only aid in learning – it can entirely replace a university class for a <em>much cheaper price</em> (the cost of a laptop and internet connection).</p><h3 id="education-is-broken">Education is broken</h3><p>Now, it might seem ironic coming from a person who develops <a href="https://academus.io">software to connect students with their education</a>, but the current US education system sucks. It worked hundreds of years ago, but has not changed much since then. The reason it worked so well is because there were not widely available sources of information such as the internet or online courses – sure, there were libraries, but if you really wanted to get educated, <em>you should go to college</em>!</p><p>In the 21st century, we have access to virtually every bit of knowledge that humans have ever known. And there are <a href="https://www.skillshare.com">services</a> that have their business model entirely revolving around this – what they do is move the college courses from a physical classroom into the simplicity of your own device for a fraction of the cost. If you're into computer science like I am, there are even services that give you <a href="https://hackhands.com">live instant help from real human beings</a> whenever you want.</p><p>That being said, I do still think <strong>there is a place for colleges in many peoples' lives</strong>. Some stuff is better learnt hands-on; for example, a budding chemist might not have access to the proper equipment to perform labs with – a college can provide this. But with fields such as computer science, one can easily be on-par with a masters-holding graduate with enough determination.</p><h3 id="a-waste-of-time">A waste of time</h3><p>Being forced to take intro or even intermediate-level college courses would be a big handicap to my free time and learning new things. College courses typically involve severely outdated technologies, at no fault to the professors that teach them – the world of technology simply moves too fast for the course syllabus to keep up!</p><p>Instead, my time would be much better used focusing on new and upcoming technologies, using my existing knowledge as a base. Then I could explore practical applications for these technologies to provide a <a href="https://tjhorner.com/portfolio/">living example of my work</a> to potential employers, which speaks louder than a piece of paper from some group of people that says I know how to do a thing.</p><h3 id="a-waste-of-money">A waste of money</h3><p>Any college that offer CS courses which would be worth my time (sorry – that sounds pretentious, but it's true) would cost a boatload of money. That money could be better spent elsewhere on programming books to expand my breadth of knowledge related to computer science, or to new hardware to execute my ideas.</p><h3 id="but-what-about-jobs-that-require-a-degree">"But what about jobs that require a degree?"</h3><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html">Many</a> <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/no-degree-required/">different</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/google-apple-college-degree-hiring-a290bca8-65a7-4de2-8fa9-d93b4c30457a.html">tech</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/red-alert-politics/more-and-more-companies-ditch-college-degree-requirements-for-jobs">companies</a> are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tech%20companies%20no%20degree">removing</a> their degree requirements, and for those that still list degrees as required, it turns out that <a href="https://talent.works/blog/2018/11/27/the-science-of-the-job-search-part-vii-you-only-need-50-of-job-requirements/">"requirements" aren't actually required</a>. And for all the rest, they tack on "or equivalent".</p><p>I am confident that with my <a href="https://github.com/tjhorner">many years of building up knowledge</a> and <a href="https://tjhorner.com/portfolio">crafting production-ready business-level applications</a>, I can satisfy the "equivalent" experience that these employers are looking for.</p><h3 id="why-not-go-to-a-tech-focused-college">"Why not go to a tech-focused college?"</h3><p>I have pondered opportunities like <a href="https://neumont.edu">Neumont College</a> or <a href="https://www.makeschool.com">Make School</a> that offer degrees in modern tech stacks and are also <em>hip and cool with the kids</em>, but they all seem to have the same bottleneck: they start with stuff I am already heavily experienced in. While I greatly appreciate their efforts to improve upon the antiquated tech curriculum commonly found in other universities, I feel that I will get little value out of these for the money I put in.</p><p>I'm not against learning. In fact, I love learning. I just don't like being taught something I already know, being forced to complete assignments based on it, and then being handed a piece of paper signed by someone I probably won't even personally interact with saying that I can do that thing. Instead, I'd rather demonstrate it.</p><p><em>Yes, I know the above is a gross oversimplification, but it illustrates my point well.</em></p><h2 id="next-i-ll-accept-a-decent-tech-job-">Next, I'll accept a decent tech job.</h2><p>I'm confident that I can find at least a decently-paying tech job that is relevant to my interests. In fact, I have already received offers from both companies and people simply looking to hire a freelancer. The problem is that I also have school, and most of these offers are full-time.</p><h3 id="but-what-if-you-can-t-find-a-tech-job">"But what if you can't find a tech job?"</h3><p>Technology-related jobs (especially software engineers) are one of the <a href="https://www.modis.com/en-us/resources/employers/top-jobs-2019/">fastest-growing industries</a> today. There are more jobs than we have people to fill them. If I can't find a tech job, then robots must have taken over.</p><h2 id="and-in-the-case-i-can-t-find-one-i-ll-explore-colleges-">And in the case I can't find one, I'll explore colleges.</h2><p>I already have a list of colleges I applied to, and ones that have accepted me. If it all comes to this (and it probably won't), I will take a look into going to college after my gap year.</p><h2 id="if-everything-else-fails-">If everything else fails...</h2><p>...then I'll simply need to look at my situation at the time then decide where to go from there.</p><hr><p>As one final thought, I'd like to note that this isn't meant to be a universal solution or any sort of advice for people at the end of their high school career – so don't decide to not attend college and blame me when your parents ask why. Everyone has their own needs in their own situations, so I encourage you to take a look at what you have: knowledge, money, and time – weigh these out and discover something that works for you.</p><p>So there's my slightly absurd plan. I hope this answered all your questions and curiosities. If you have any more, you can comment down below.</p><p>Thanks for reading.

We go around a couple times until we get to the big boxes. It's time to open mine!</p><p>I take off the wrapping paper slowly to reveal what's inside: a "Propel Ultra-X + WiFi" – a drone! I thank my grandmother for the gift and make a silly remark about how I always wanted one but they were always too expensive to justify it.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it seems this model is able to be controlled via an app on iOS or Android devices – neat! Frustratingly, I open the horribly packaged drone and play around with it to get used to the controls. I attach the included phone holder to the controller and download the app. I notice that there are several other apps made by the developer and they all seem to be the same thing, but with slightly different graphics... odd, but I'm having fun so I dismiss it.</p><p>Through the app, you can view a live video feed from the drone as well as control it – typical drone stuff. I wasn't satisfied with this, though. I needed to discover how it worked.</p><h2 id="sniffing-the-packets">Sniffing the Packets</h2><p>When I got home from my grandparents' house, my first inclination was to download the wonderful <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/grey-shirts/packet-capture/packet-capture-1-4-7-release/packet-capture-1-4-7-android-apk-download/">Packet Capture</a> app (which was removed from the Play Store for some reason?), launch the drone app on my phone and sniff the packets. Surely, this will reveal the communication between the drone and app.</p><p>Well, sort of...</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hacking Chinese Drones for Fun and (No) Profit"><figcaption>Packets captured by the Packet Capture app.</figcaption></figure><p>The packets above were over TCP port 7060. This is the video stream. Similar packets were captured over TCP port 8060. However, neither of these ports were used to control the drone!</p><p>Using <code>lewei_cmd</code> as a starting point, I found <a href="https://mehmetburakeker.com/2017/05/01/opencv-ile-nesne-takip-eden-drone-projesi-cx-32w/">this blog post</a> and discovered that the actual drone commands were sent via UDP packets to port 50000 on the drone. Apparently, the app I was using couldn't capture UDP packets, only TCP. So I searched for another way...</p><p>I looked for another app that was capable of capturing UDP packets from other apps on the system – some claimed to be able to, but they were broken and didn't work with my device for some reason (probably because they were made when Android Gingerbread was still very much a thing).</p><p>Ok, so capturing packets on-device is out of the question here... let's try doing it externally. I fired up Wireshark on my MacBook, connected to the same network that the phone was connected to and... nothing!</p><p>Well, let's try using monitor mode. It worked, sort of! It yielded just a few UDP packets between the 2 devices, but not consistently enough to tinker with them, so I needed to find yet another way.</p><p>After fiddling with my WiFi Pineapple, trying out different things like network bridging, monitor mode on the Pineapple itself, and many more things, I felt defeated. There was one more thing I hadn't tried: my iPhone. One would think Android would be better to capture packets on – especially a rooted device like I have! However, it turns out there is a tool on macOS called <code>rvictl</code> that lets you create a virtual interface on your Mac that simply mirrors network traffic that goes through your iPhone.</p><p>And sure enough, creating that virtual interface and capturing packets on Wireshark showed the UDP packets I was looking for this entire time. <em>Eureka! </em>I wrote a quick filter to only capture the packets between the phone and drone and got to work. It took around 3 hours to get to this point.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hacking Chinese Drones for Fun and (No) Profit"><figcaption>UDP packets being sent from my iPhone to the drone.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-messages">The Messages</h2><p>I learned a few things from inspecting these UDP messages:</p><ul><li>They are always 8 bytes long.</li><li>They always start with <code>66</code> and end in <code>99</code>.</li><li>They are sent constantly in rapid succession while the app is open.</li></ul><p>The next step was to change some things in the app to see how the messages themselves changed. So I started taking some notes as I fiddled with knobs and buttons in the app (you can read the notes <a href="https://git.horner.tj/snippets/7">here</a> – the information there is probably incorrect). Here is a summary of what I found:</p><ul><li>1st byte – Header: <code>66</code></li><li>2nd byte – Left/right movement (0-254, with 128 being neutral)</li><li>3rd byte – Forward/backward movement (0-254, with 128 being neutral)</li><li>4th byte – Throttle (elevation) (0-254, with 128 being neutral)</li><li>5th byte – Turning movement (0-254, with 128 being neutral)</li><li>6th byte – Reserved for commands (0 = no command)</li><li>7th byte – Checksum (XOR of bytes 2, 3, 4, and 5)</li><li>8th byte – Footer: <code>99</code></li></ul><p>These bytes (represented in hex) are used to represent certain commands:</p><ul><li><code>01</code> – Auto Take-Off/Land</li><li><code>80</code> – Calibrate Gyro</li><li><code>40</code> – Unlock Motor</li></ul><p>To send a command, the app sets the 6th and 7th byte to the corresponding command number for approximately 1 second.</p><p>For example, if you wanted to tell the drone to take off, you would send these messages for around 1 second:</p><pre><code>66 80 80 80 80 01 01 99</code></pre><p>Or if you wanted the drone to move right:</p><pre><code>66 a8 80 80 80 00 40 99</code></pre><h2 id="ok-but-why">Ok, but why?</h2><p>You can do cool stuff with a programmable drone!</p><p>I have created a sample <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dronelib">library</a> for this drone with the source code available <a href="https://git.horner.tj/tj/dronelib">here</a>.

There was a first-time village called the “Voting Village”. It was a village where you can join in the fun of breaking into various voting registration and ballot machines. My friend Sean and I saw this village in the con book and first decided we would walk around to see everyone’s progress for around 30 minutes before attending a talk. Little did we know, it would turn into an ~8 hour hacking session on voting machines.</p><h1 id="the-machine">The Machine</h1><p>We decided to work on the <a href="http://www.essvote.com/products/5/11/electronic-poll-books/expresspoll-5000%C2%AE/">ExpressPoll 5000</a> voter registration machine since nobody had made any real progress on it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hacking Voting Machines at DEF CON 25"></figure><p>It uses an ancient PCMCIA/CF slot to transfer data and hold various database files on it. Luckily, the village provided a ton of PCMCIA cards to play around with and a PCMCIA to USB converter so we could use it as a storage device on our laptops.</p><h1 id="general-discoveries">General Discoveries</h1><p>Here is a list of discoveries that we found useful in exploiting the device:</p><ul><li>It runs Windows CE 5.0</li><li>ExpressPoll software is a giant .NET app with the assembly name <code>ExPoll</code></li><li>ExpressPoll software uses WinForms for UI</li><li>Bootloader is proprietary</li><li>Processor’s architecture is ARM</li><li>Database file is stored on memory card (more details later)</li></ul><h1 id="the-exploits">The Exploits</h1><p>Several exploits were tested against this, such as the usual suspects: buffer overflow, Windows key shortcuts, network exploits, etc. Here is what worked and what didn’t.</p><h2 id="arbitrary-firmware-injection">Arbitrary Firmware Injection</h2><p>When the memory card is inserted into the machine and it boots up, the bootloader first checks for a file called <code>NK.BIN</code>. If this file is found, it will attempt to load it into RAM and boot into it with <em>absolutely no signature verification</em>. The firmware is then flashed and is permanent upon next boot.</p><p>The <code>NK.BIN</code> file is generally a Windows CE 5.0 update for the machine bundled with the ExpressPoll software, but an attacker is able to upload and run any custom NT kernel, and possibly a Linux image (untested thus far).</p><p>We tested this on our ExpressPoll 5000, and sure enough, it loaded our Windows CE without complaining:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hacking Voting Machines at DEF CON 25"></figure><h2 id="arbitrary-bootloader-injection">Arbitrary Bootloader Injection</h2><p>Very similar to the firmware injection exploit, the bootloader also checks for an update to itself while booting, with the file name <code>EBOOT.BIN</code>. It is also loaded without signature verification, but we have not been able to get a bootloader to successfully work on a machine. However, the bootloader injection itself is confirmed to work since the bootloader we put onto the <code>EBOOT.BIN</code>file is indeed flashed and is present upon reboot without the memory card. This also means we basically bricked the thing (we had to get another, heh).</p><h2 id="-net-resources-file-override">.NET <code>.resources</code> File Override</h2><p>When the ExpressPoll software is “launched” from the “Launch Express Poll” button, it reads the memory card for a file named <code>ExPoll.resources</code>. This is a resources file defining any resources that the app will use, such as translation strings, images, buttons, layouts, etc. It would generally be used for overriding and customizing the registration process (for example, adding your own logo instead of having the Diebold logo.)</p><p>The weak point in this system is that buttons (and potentially other UI elements) can be overriden to take different actions, such as run an executable stored on the memory card (which is mounted in something like <code>/Storage Card</code>) or run a command.</p><p>If an <code>ExPoll.resources</code> file is found, it will first load it into memory, use it for that session, and also copy it to the device’s internal memory so it can be used again.</p><p>This vulnerability was confirmed by creating a random .NET <code>.resources</code> file, naming it <code>ExPoll.resources</code> and copying to the memory card. We popped it into the machine, pressed the “Launch Express Poll” button, and (as expected), it errored. Woohoo! It loaded the file. Sadly, since it also copied to memory, it is essentially bricked if you give it a bad file (you can’t get to the “Launch Express Poll” button).

This is an standard unencrypted SQLite3 database, including <em>literally all the information</em>. Polls, parties, voters, all of it. (Link coming soon with sample database.) Using this information, an attacker could launch several types of attacks:</p><ul><li>Data exfiltrationFor example, the attacker could easily come with a card that has an empty database, and silently swap out the card when they register to vote, thus obtaining the entire voter database (which includes: name, address, last 4 of SSN, signature, and many others) for the county.</li><li>Falsifying voter informationFor example, the attacker could forge their own database with fake voter information (e.g. change their parties/signatures, etc.) and place it into the machine when they register to vote.</li><li>Other attacks.

If you’d like to jump to a certain part, use these links:</p><ul><li><a href="#part-i-chat-bot">Part I: Chat bot</a></li><li><a href="#part-ii-inline-bot">Part II: Inline bot</a></li><li><a href="#part-iii-conclusion">Part III: Conclusion</a></li></ul><h1 id="part-i-chat-bot">Part I: Chat bot</h1><p>Telegram has two types of bots: chat bots and inline bots. Chat bots use commands (such as <strong>/start</strong>, <strong>/help</strong>, etc.) to interact with users. Inline bots can instead be called from anywhere and help users find and send content to any chat they wish. This section covers chat bots.</p><h3 id="step-0-1-acquire-node-js-and-npm">Step 0.1: Acquire Node.js and npm</h3><p>You should have already done this before the event, but it’s a pretty small download if you still need to get it. Here are links to the version of Node.js we will be using for this workshop:</p><ul><li><strong>Windows</strong>: <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.6.0/node-v6.6.0-x64.msi">https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.6.0/node-v6.6.0-x64.msi</a></li><li><strong>macOS</strong>: <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.6.0/node-v6.6.0.pkg">https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.6.0/node-v6.6.0.pkg</a></li><li><strong>Linux</strong>: You should already know how to get Node.js.</li></ul><h3 id="step-0-2-get-telegram">Step 0.2: Get Telegram</h3><p>Since we’re making a Telegram bot, you’ll need a Telegram account. Head over to<a href="https://telegram.org/dl">telegram.org/dl</a> and create your account.</p><h3 id="step-1-set-up-your-project-directory">Step 1: Set up your project directory</h3><p>Now that we have Node.js and npm installed and our Telegram account is ready, we can start with the project. Open up your preferred terminal and run these commands:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir codeday-telegram-bot
cd codeday-telegram-bot
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have a directory for our Telegram bot, but we need a package.json, this tells npm information about our project. To do this, (in the same terminal window) we need to run this:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">npm init
</code></pre>
<p>This command will tell npm to initialize a pre-made package.json in our project directory. Just hit enter at all of the prompts, we can worry about those later.</p><h3 id="step-2-install-necessary-packages">Step 2: Install necessary packages</h3><p>For this project, we will only need one npm package. An npm package is essentially a piece of code (“package”) in the npm registry that we can download with a simple command, <code>npm install</code>.</p><p>We’re going to use a package called <code>node-telegram-bot-api</code>, we can install it like so:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save node-telegram-bot-api
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--save</code> part signals npm to save this package to our package.json so it is easily installed later, along with any other dependencies that our package may need.</p><h3 id="step-3-get-a-telegram-bot-token">Step 3: Get a Telegram bot token</h3><p>Using Telegram, contact <a href="https://telegram.me/Botfather">@botfather</a> and use the <strong>/newbot</strong> command to create a new bot. Name it whatever you’d like with any username, it doesn’t matter.</p><h3 id="step-4-write-some-code-">Step 4: Write some code!</h3><p>Now that we have our bot token, we can use it to interface with the Telegram Bot API.</p><p>Create an index.js file in your project directory, then open it in your favorite text editor. Here’s some simple “Hello world” boilerplate code I’ve written to assist with this step:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">var TelegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api'),
    // Be sure to replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token on this line.
    telegram = new TelegramBot(&quot;YOUR_BOT_TOKEN&quot;, { polling: true });

telegram.on(&quot;text&quot;, (message) =&gt; {
  telegram.sendMessage(message.chat.id, &quot;Hello world&quot;);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, what this code does is include the library we downloaded from npm earlier, then instantiated a new <code>TelegramBot</code> object with our token and told it to poll for updates from Telegram. Then it will listen for the “text” event (which, in this library, is a simple text message) and then send a message to the chat the original message was saved saying “Hello world”.</p><p>Now, run the index.js file with this command:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">node index
</code></pre>
<p>Send your bot a message. It should reply with “Hello world”. If it does, awesome! If it doesn’t, ask me (if you’re attending this workshop in person, that is).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/hello-world.png" class="kg-image" alt="Intro to Node.js: Making a Telegram Bot"></figure><h3 id="step-5-implement-a-simple-command">Step 5: Implement a simple command</h3><p>In its current state, this bot is not very useful. Let’s make it useful, how about by adding a <strong>/codeday</strong> command that tells us when CodeDay ends! We will be utilizing two more libraries here, <strong>codeday-clear</strong> and <strong>moment</strong>. <strong>codeday-clear</strong> is the official Node.js library for interacting with the Clear API. Clear is our internal CodeDay management system and has a very nice API. We will be using this API to get the ending date of CodeDay and then use <strong>moment</strong> to convert it into a human-readable format.</p><p>To install these libraries:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save codeday-clear moment
</code></pre>
<p>In our code, we then need to include these two libraries and instantiate a <code>Clear</code> instance. Since the Clear API requires access to Clear and an API token/secret pair, I have created a sample app with limited permissions for the purpose of this workshop:</p><ul><li><strong>Token</strong>: 1YZiGaj3baaLU8IKVsASRIWaNF2oJNg0</li><li><strong>Secret</strong>: 1COMnWyGnGBsNqkhaZ6WMBWB9UWZw6QZ</li></ul><p>Here’s what it should look like:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">var Clear = require('codeday-clear'),
    // Our sample app token and secret
    clear = new Clear(&quot;1YZiGaj3baaLU8IKVsASRIWaNF2oJNg0&quot;, &quot;1COMnWyGnGBsNqkhaZ6WMBWB9UWZw6QZ&quot;);

// moment is not a class, just a simple function
var moment = require('moment');
</code></pre>
<p>This code should go right after where we declare the <code>telegram</code> instance (this should be line 3 if you are following along). Now that we have our Clear and moment instances declared, we can use them in a simple command. Let’s replace the code inside of the “text” event with something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">telegram.on(&quot;text&quot;, (message) =&gt; {
  if(message.text.toLowerCase().indexOf(&quot;/codeday&quot;) === 0){
    clear.getEventById(&quot;oo4QIuKQQTYA&quot;, (codedayEvent) =&gt; {
      var endsAt = moment(codedayEvent.ends_at * 1000);
      telegram.sendMessage(message.chat.id, &quot;CodeDay ends &quot; + endsAt.fromNow() + &quot;!&quot;);
    });
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening here:</p><ul><li>We check with the JavaScript <code>indexOf</code> function if the message starts with /codeday</li><li>If it does, we tell the Clear library to grab the event with ID oo4QIuKQQTYA (that’s San Diego Fall 2016’s ID)</li><li>We use a callback function once it gets the event, and then parse the <code>ends_at</code> date with moment. (We multiply it by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds (which moment understands), since Clear sends this date in a UNIX timestamp format.)</li><li>We then use moment’s <code>fromNow</code> function to get the relative time (e.g. “in 10 hours”) of the <code>endsAt</code> date and then send that all through the Telegram API.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/simple-command.png" class="kg-image" alt="Intro to Node.js: Making a Telegram Bot"></figure><h3 id="step-6-getting-fancy-with-markdown">Step 6: Getting fancy with Markdown</h3><p>Telegram supports messages sent with <strong>Markdown</strong>, a simple way to format text. Let’s make the end date bold as an example.</p><p>In Telegram’s version of Markdown, we will surround the text we want to bold with asterisks, so the raw message we send to Telegram should look something like this:</p><blockquote><em>CodeDay ends *in 2 months*!</em></blockquote><p>To implement this, it’s rather simple; all we need to do is surround the end date in asterisks and then pass the <code>parse_mode</code> parameter to the Telegram API and set it to “Markdown”, this will tell the Telegram API that we want the text to render as Markdown.</p><p>The modified code could look something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">telegram.sendMessage(message.chat.id, &quot;CodeDay ends *&quot; + endsAt.fromNow() + &quot;*!&quot;, {
  parse_mode: &quot;Markdown&quot;
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now when we run the <strong>/codeday</strong> command, it will look like this instead:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/markdown.png" class="kg-image" alt="Intro to Node.js: Making a Telegram Bot"></figure><p>Telegram also supports italics, inline code, code blocks, and inline URLs along with the bold option we just used.</p><h1 id="part-ii-inline-bot">Part II: Inline bot</h1><p>This section will cover how to turn this bot into an inline bot, which can be called from anywhere and help users find and send content from your bot.</p><h3 id="step-0-enable-inline-mode-in-botfather">Step 0: Enable inline mode in Botfather</h3><p>Bots don’t have inline mode enabled by default, so you need to send the <strong>/setinline</strong> command to Botfather to enable it. You can use anything as your placeholder text, but I used “Search CodeDays…” as mine.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/botfather-setinline.png" class="kg-image" alt="Intro to Node.js: Making a Telegram Bot"></figure><p>After you enable inline mode, you may need to restart whatever Telegram client you’re using for the changes to take effect (since they’re cached). Once you restart, type your bot’s username then a space. If you see the placeholder text you set, you’re ready for the next step.</p><h3 id="step-1-implement-inline-queries">Step 1: Implement inline queries</h3><p>Now we need to tell our script how to react to inline queries. To do this, here’s some boilerplate “Hello world” code I’ve written to simplify the process:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">telegram.on(&quot;inline_query&quot;, (query) =&gt; {
  telegram.answerInlineQuery(query.id, [
    {
      type: &quot;article&quot;,
      id: &quot;testarticle&quot;,
      title: &quot;Hello world&quot;,
      input_message_content: {
        message_text: &quot;Hello, world! This was sent from my super cool inline bot.&quot;
      }
    }
  ]);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Upon an inline query…</li><li>Respond with an array with 1 “article” result…</li><li>Which has a title of “Hello world” and sends the message “Hello, world! This was sent from my super cool inline bot.”</li></ul><h3 id="step-2-implement-clear-api">Step 2: Implement Clear API</h3><p>Now let’s actually make it show the CodeDay events. We need to iterate over every event and turn them into an object the Telegram API understands, so you could have something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">telegram.on(&quot;inline_query&quot;, (query) =&gt; {
  var searchTerm = query.query.trim();

  clear.getRegions((regions) =&gt; {
    var queryResults = [ ];

    regions.forEach((region) =&gt; {
      if(region.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) !== -1 &amp;&amp; region.current_event &amp;&amp; region.current_event.venue){
        queryResults.push({
          type: &quot;article&quot;,
          id: region.id,
          title: &quot;CodeDay &quot; + region.name,
          description: &quot;Hosted at &quot; + region.current_event.venue.full_address,
          input_message_content: {
            latitude: region.location.lat,
            longitude: region.location.lng,
            title: &quot;CodeDay &quot; + region.name,
            address: region.current_event.venue.full_address
          }
        });
      }
    });

    telegram.answerInlineQuery(query.id, queryResults);
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>So what we’re doing here is…</p><ul><li>Upon an inline query…</li><li>Ask Clear for a list of events…</li><li>Then turn those events into objects the Telegram API can understand…</li><li>And make the message content the venue the CodeDay is at.</li><li>Add the result to the results array.</li><li>Send the results back to the API.</li></ul><h1 id="part-iii-conclusion">Part III: Conclusion</h1><p>Now that you know the basics of bot creation, I encourage you to play around with Telegram’s bot API and make something awesome with it!

I never went on Facebook at the time, but I was on there for who knows what reason. One of my suggested groups was TeenDev. I then got promptly invited to HS Hackers after I joined TeenDev. I also went to CodeDay Spring on May 24-25. I went with my friend Devin and didn't win anything.</p><h3 id="photos-from-may">Photos from May</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/god-dammit.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="2014 Year in Review"></figure><h1 id="june">JUNE</h1><p>I can't really remember anything from June other than I got my Nexus 5.

Its goal is to get students into programming which is a big field. I was one of the organizers for CodeDay San Diego along with <a href="http://tompaulus.com/">Tom Paulus</a> and Ayesha Haque.</p><p>I came at 10-ish to get things set up at the venue, Ansir Innovation Center. Two of my friends came with me and they became slaves for us. One of our jobs was to get 4 large bags of ice from the 7-11 a half a mile away from the venue.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/image-11.png" class="kg-image" alt="CodeDay San Diego Fall 2014"></figure><p>When the doors opened, everyone poured in. So many devices were plugged in so we had a power outage. The internet was backed up so much, we had to kill the internet for a while. We had lunch shortly after that at 12. It was provided by Stacked and it was delicious! We then had Tom kick off the event giving them a rundown then thanking the sponsors. People also pitched their ideas, it had really crazy stuff from a game where you play as Barack Obama and kill ISIS to an application that would gather data from all around the world and predict the future. At 1, everyone assembled their teams and went to work!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/image-12.png" class="kg-image" alt="CodeDay San Diego Fall 2014"></figure><p>For dinner, we had pizza from Papa Johns. Around this time, the internet went completely down. We had one participant try and fix it for hours, but couldn't succeed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.horner.tj/content/images/2018/12/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="CodeDay San Diego Fall 2014"></figure><p>Nearing the end, all the teams presented their projects and judges judged. We tore down at 12 on Sunday and congratulated everyone. There is much much more that happened, and I'll tell you in a later Medium post.</p><p>Cheers!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
